This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

The site can be viewed running on https://rocky-tor-78018.herokuapp.com/

I chose React JS for this app even though it's not a language I work in frequently (this is only my second React project, after my first one a couple of weeks ago). This demonstrates that I can pick up the basics of a new framework and syntax quickly.
