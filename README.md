This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

The site can be viewed running at https://rocky-tor-78018.herokuapp.com/

I chose React JS for this app even though it's a language I've had very little exposure to. I wanted a reason to practice some React and show that I can learn quickly.

#Running the App Locally

To run the app locally, do the following steps in a command window. You can instead follow the instructions to set up React using the instructions provided by [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/react-setup-i) if you prefer.
 - First, [download Node](https://nodejs.org/en/). This will also install npm (a package manager) automatically.
 - Next, create a directory where you would like to store your app and `cd` into that directory in your terminal.
 - Type `npm init` at the command prompt. The defaults are usually fine for all the prompts.
 - Then, type `npm install --save react` at the command prompt.
 - Finally, type `npm install --save react-dom` to install React-Dom.

Then, pull down this repo and type `npm start` at a command prompt. That should launch a browser window pointing to localhost:3000, or you can type that in yourself once npm finishes launching. You may have to give firewall permissions to allow npm to start.

#Running Tests

To run the test suite, simply type `npm test` at the command prompt in your terminal. If you don't want to see the test output in the terminal window, type `npm test --no-watch` instead.
