This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

The site can be viewed running at https://rocky-tor-78018.herokuapp.com/

I chose React JS for this app even though it's not a language I work in frequently - I wanted a reason to practice some React.

To run the app locally, you can follow the instructions to set up React at the above Create React App link (will involve installing Node). Then, pull down this repo and type `npm start` at a command prompt.
